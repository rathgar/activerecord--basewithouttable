ActiveRecordBaseWithoutTable
============================

Get the power of ActiveRecord models, including validation, without having a table in the database.

  class Contact < ActiveRecord::BaseWithoutTable
    column :name, :string
    column :email_address, :string
    column :message, :text
    
    validates_presence_of :name, :email_address, :string
  end
  
This model can be used just like a regular model based on a table, except it will never be saved to the database.
